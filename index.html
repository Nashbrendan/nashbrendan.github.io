                    <ul>
                        <li>I am a seasoned professional with a versatile background encompassing project management, technical leadership, and process optimization, specializing in the management of advanced liquid cooling solutions for data centers.</li>
                        <li>Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a mastery of thermal modules, spearheading multimillion-dollar projects as TPM, advocating for customers as QPM, and led NPI initiatives for Fortune 100 companies.</li>
                        <li>My skill set extends to technical advisement, leveraging cutting-edge design tools, and refining cooling strategies tailored for Data center application & ADAS technology. A focal point of my expertise involves overseeing new manufacturing plants, drafting supplier audits, second source identification, assisting on process approvals. I have worked with both waterfall & Agile methodologies.</li>
                        <li>As a Technical Program Manager (TPM), I leveraged my technical expertise to guide my team in resolving quality issues. Recognizing the impact of my contributions, my role evolved into a Quality Program Manager (QPM). Here, my primary focus was on meticulously completing SCAR reports, conducting Failure Analysis (FA), and identifying root causes, whether they were design-related, process-related, or tied to other factors. I was entrusted with leading critical quality issues, representing our company before customers. Notably, a senior figure from a prominent customer praised my adeptness in leading substantial discussions—a compliment that speaks volumes.</li>
                        <li>Armed with a Six Sigma Black Belt certification, I've not only fortified my technical prowess but also harnessed it to steer pivotal changes in quality management. Through this journey, I've recognized that Six Sigma isn't just a certification—it's a guiding philosophy. It compels me to meticulously analyze, strategize, and execute with a laser focus on quality enhancement. This approach, coupled with my innate leadership and problem-solving skills, amplifies my role as a Six Sigma Black Belt-certified professional, equipped to not only address challenges but transform them into opportunities for excellence.</li>
